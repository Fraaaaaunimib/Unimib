This is my public repository of what I've been doing in university this year.

I'm studying ***computer science*** at Bicocca University in Milan, and been enjoying it so far.

We're studying Java, and then next year we'll (I think) learn C++, I think... there are some things I don't like about Java, for example the fact that, sometimes,
we write some code, it doesn't work, and then we rewrite it the exact same way and it works ;-;

It's... strange? As far as we could see there wasn't anything wrong in it, and they were written literally the same.

Anyway, I hope you like these console stuff, they're really basic. If you want something more amazing,
check out Starboy Notepad on my repository! Full on Visual Basic 6 text editor with a modern look and feel. Recently, Starboy 3 will come out too,
with Fluent Design, animations, click animations, colours and so much more inside.
